1. I need separate the output box. The same way as is input. (input type text + select) for example: value 100 in text box + currency symbol USD in select box. It works good but for design purposes.

2. send data (selected by customer) to another form. FORM 2

- if he chooses let say: 1 BTC =  4478 GBP - then send those data to FORM 2 (where he will be asked for another data).
- show those data as variables (data from the first form)
- condition if (BTC, ETH, XRP) to know what crypto he selected in the FORM 1
